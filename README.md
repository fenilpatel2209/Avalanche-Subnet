# DeFi-Empire

## Overview

Welcome to the DeFi Empire, a cutting-edge project introducing the ERC20 token, "Fenil Fox" (FF), along with a robust Vault contract. Designed to adhere to the ERC20 standard for decentralized transactions, FF ensures secure and transparent financial activities within the blockchain space. The project enables users to participate in efficient decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, establishing a foundation for a new era of decentralized financial interactions.

## Token and Vault Contracts

### Fenil Fox (FF) Token

Buzzinga (BZ) is an ERC20 token that provides essential features for decentralized transactions, including total supply tracking, balance management, and events for transfers and approvals. Users can engage in secure and transparent financial transactions using FF within the DeFi Empire ecosystem.

### Vault Contract

The Vault contract, built to interact seamlessly with BZ through the IERC20 interface, offers a secure platform for users to deposit and withdraw funds. Users earn shares proportionate to their contributions, creating a fair and efficient system for decentralized finance activities.
